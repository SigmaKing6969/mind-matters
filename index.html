    <h2>How Mental Health Affects Me</h2>
    <p>Mental health affects every aspect of my life, from how I feel on a day-to-day basis to how I interact with others. Struggles with anxiety, depression, and other conditions can affect my work, relationships, and overall well-being. It's important to recognize the impact mental health has on my personal growth and seek support when necessary.</p>

    <h2>How Mental Health Affects the Community</h2>
    <p>Mental health challenges are not just individual experiences; they have far-reaching effects on the community. When individuals struggle, they may withdraw, reducing their participation in community activities, work, or social events. This can lead to isolation and a lack of support networks, affecting the community's overall wellbeing and growth.</p>

<section id="change-community" class="content-section">
    <h2>What To Change in Community?</h2>
    <p>I can play an active role in raising awareness and reducing the stigma surrounding mental health in my community. By encouraging open conversations, supporting mental health initiatives, and promoting resources for mental health care, I can help create a safe and inclusive environment where everyone feels supported and understood.</p>
</section>

<section id="create-community" class="content-section">
    <h2>What to Create for Community?</h2>
    <p>One way I can make a positive impact is by organizing community-based events that promote mental well-being. These could include workshops on stress management, peer support groups, or activities like mindfulness walks or yoga sessions. Creating spaces for open dialogue about mental health will allow people to connect and learn, fostering a stronger, more resilient community.</p>
